Dear Students,

Congratulations on making it to the task-based selection round for the Data Science Intern role at Buckman!

As part of this round, you will be required to build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based chatbot that can answer user queries by retrieving relevant information from a given set of documents.

Task Details:

The chatbot should process and extract information from multiple document types:
PDF, DOCX, CSV → Sample files will be provided.
Image and Video → You are required to choose your own dataset and build the logic/model for processing these formats.
The chatbot should return accurate and relevant answers based on the user's queries.
Bonus points if you do not use the LangChain framework.

Evaluation Criteria:

Accuracy & Relevance: How well the chatbot retrieves and generates responses.
Model Architecture: Efficient implementation and logical structuring.
Handling of Different Formats: Proper parsing and information extraction.
Creativity & Optimization: Efficient use of techniques for better performance.
Submission Deadline: 25 March 2025 (Tuesday - 5 pm)
Submission Format: Code, PPT/Word

 
We look forward to seeing your innovative solutions!

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out.

 
Regards,

Ramaswamy Ganapathy
